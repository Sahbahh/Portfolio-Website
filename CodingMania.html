            <p>
              Coding Mania is a group project for Introduction to Software 
              Engineering CMPT276 course at Simon Fraser University. This project is a <span>2D 
                arcade-style game</span> where the main character, a programmer, needs to 
              gather all the code snippets (regular rewards) before running the 
              code (endpoint). The game is set on a board where the character 
              navigates while avoiding errors (punishments) which decrease the
               code quality (score). Bugs are present on the board, and an encounter
                between the character and a bug leads to an immediate loss. The game 
                also features energy drinks (bonus rewards) that appear on the board 
                to enhance the player's score. <br>

              The game was developed using an <span>object-oriented approach (OOP)</span> with a focus 
              on the <span>Entity-Component-System model</span>. Classes were created for the 
              entities, game states, and user inputs, while also implementing manager 
              classes for handling entities and game states. Entities included the player 
              character, enemies, and various rewards. External libraries such as 
              AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and IO were utilized for rendering 
              graphics and handling user inputs.<br>
              
              The game code went through a series of modifications for efficiency 
              and better user experience, with changes in the implementation of 
              certain methods, inclusion of additional features, and reworking 
              of some initial designs. For example, we added <span>threading</span> to create 
              a tick timer to indicate when each entity should move and update, 
              added a <span>render method</span> for better graphics, and implemented various 
              updates in entity management. <br>
              
              Thorough <span>unit and integration tests</span> were conducted to ensure the 
              functionality of all game features. These tests covered constructor 
              methods, value manipulations, interactions between entities, and 
              responses to user inputs. These tests helped identify bugs and led 
              to the modification of certain production codes to enhance the game's 
              performance and user experience. Automated testing was used alongside 
              <span>manual functional and UI testing</span>. <br>
              
              Overall, the development of "Coding Mania" involved effective teamwork, 
              efficient task division, continuous learning, and a shared commitment 
              to enhancing product quality.<br> <br>
