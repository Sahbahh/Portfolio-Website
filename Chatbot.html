            This project is a part of Operating Systems I CMPT 300 course at Simon Fraser University.    
            In this project, I developed a <span>simple Linux-based chat system</span>, enabling communication between users on 
            distinct terminals. <span>Core Linux concepts</span>, such as <span>Threads</span> and the
             <span>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</span>, were harnessed during the development process. The architecture 
            was built using <span>Pthreads</span>, known for its kernel-level thread implementation in 
            Linux, while interprocess communication was facilitated by <span>datagram sockets </span>
            utilizing UDP. <br>

            The chat system operates through <span>two Linux processes</span>, each initialized by a 
            different user. Each process consists of <span>four threads</span>. The first thread handles 
            keyboard input, the second thread awaits incoming UDP datagrams, the third thread
             manages message printing, and the fourth thread is responsible for transmitting
              data to the remote Unix process over the network using UDP. The processes can
               run on different machines and communicate via the internet.  <br>

            The threads share access to an <span>Abstract Data Type (ADT)</span> list. This list holds 
            messages that need to be either sent to the remote chat client or printed to the 
            local screen. The input thread adds keyboard input to the list, while the UDP 
            sender thread pulls from the list to send messages to the remote client. The UDP
             receiver thread, upon receiving a message, adds it to the print list, and the 
             console output thread prints each received message. <br>

            The system supports <span>command-line arguments</span>, which define the IP address and port 
            number of the remote client as well as the port number for listening to incoming 
            UDP packets. The program was structured to be executed with the format: `lets-talk
             [my port number] [remote/local machine IP] [remote/local port number]`. <br>

            Additionally, the project integrated a simple <span>cipher encryption/decryption 
              mechanism</span> with a fixed key, along with online status checking functionality. 
            The chat system also supports sending and receiving long lines of text, as well
             as quitting the connection with the "!exit" command. This command results in a 
             clean termination of the program on both terminals. The system was optimized to 
             avoid deadlock and infinite loops, thereby ensuring efficient CPU usage. <br>

            The project was developed following best coding practices, such as checking 
            return values on all socket functions, appropriately using `fflush(stdout)`, 
            and passing Valgrind checks for memory leak detection and clean program 
            termination. This helped to ensure the robustness and reliability of the 
            implemented chat system.<br><br>
