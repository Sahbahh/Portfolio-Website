                This group project is from Cybersecurity CMPT318 course at Simon Fraser University.
                In this project, my team explored the application of various <span>machine learning</span> techniques, 
                specifically <span>Hidden Markov Models (HMM)</span> and <span>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</span>, for the 
                purpose of <span>anomaly detection</span> in household electricity consumption data over a 
                three-year period. <br>

                The team started by preprocessing the time-series dataset using <span>Principal Component 
                    Analysis (PCA)</span> to reduce dimensionality, selecting the most informative features while 
                minimizing redundancy. This step allowed for better visualization and understanding of 
                the dataset and the relationships between its components. <br>

                Once the data was prepared, we trained and tested a multivariate Hidden Markov Model 
                (HMM).Our team faced challenges in determining the right number of states, 
                initially leading to overfitting and then underfitting the model. However, 
                through trial and error, the model was adjusted to achieve better performance. <br>

                As an alternate approach, reinforcement learning was discussed due to its 
                potential advantages in the context of the project. RL employs an agent, which 
                learns to make optimal decisions based on reward and penalty mechanisms derived 
                from its interactions with the environment. Given the sequential nature of 
                time-series data and the possibility of incomplete data, RL offered flexibility 
                in handling these conditions, thereby improving the robustness of anomaly 
                detection.<br>

                RWe measured the results based on the Log Likelihoods and Bayesian Information 
                Criterion (BIC) of the HMM model with different datasets. The datasets with 
                injected anomalies showed that the model was capable of detecting these 
                irregularities. <br>

                Through the course of the project, we learned valuable lessons about PCA, 
                HMM, and RL, their applications in time series analysis, and the importance of 
                careful feature selection and state determination. We also acknowledged the benefits of 
                troubleshooting, testing, and analysis in reaching optimal solutions. Overall, 
                this project serves as an exploration of advanced machine learning methodologies for 
                effective anomaly detection in time series data.<br> <br>
